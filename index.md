Welcome to the Hispanics in Computing website. We are a group of Latinx/Hispanics that are interested or work in computing. Our group includes industry representatives, faculty, researchers, students, and others. The sole purpose of our group is to serve as mentors and sponsors for other Latinx/Hispanics interested in computing.

Back in April 2011, we started the listserv. Shortly after that we have added a website, facebook, twitter, and slack channel. The initial list was created by Jose Andre Morales (Carnegie Mellon University - CERT) and Manuel A. Pérez-Quiñones (UNCC).

The goals of the group are:

1. Create an online community bringing toghether students, professors and researchers in the Computing Sciences with a particular focus on Hispanics.

2. Facilitate the dissemination of opportunities for Hispanics/Latinos, as well as events, conferences, workshops, opportunities, announcements, news and opinions to all interested individuals.

3. Foster growth of a open forum to speak openly the ideas and opinions relevant to Hispanics and other minorities.

Thanks for visiting.
