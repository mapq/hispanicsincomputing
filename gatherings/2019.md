**Birds of a Feather**: Hispanics in Computing Community

**Abstract:**
The Hispanics in Computing community was founded a few months before the Tapia 2009 Conference. Since then, the group has been meeting at this annual conference. The group has grown in numbers and online presence (Facebook, LinkedIn, and <http://www.hispanicsincomputing.com/>). The impact of this gathering in our community has been tremendous. Several members of the community that attended our BoF as young graduate students are now in tenure track positions or employed in research organizations. Once again, we propose to hold our annual BoF at the Tapia Conference. The gathering will allow many of us to meet face to face and discuss issues facing Hispanics. As the undergraduate population attending Tapia grows, it is important to serve as mentors for the new students starting their careers in computing. The goal for this year’s gathering is to explore how to do virtual mentoring to help increase ties within the community.
