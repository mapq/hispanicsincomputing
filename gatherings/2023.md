We had our first ever gathering at SIGCSE.

**Birds of a Feather**: Hispanics in Computing

**Abstract:**
The Hispanics in Computing group has been around for over a decade and serves as a networking group bringing together members of this community. Members of the group organize gatherings at national conferences to strengthen the social ties that connect this small community. This Birds of a Feather seeks to bring together Hispanics and other members of the CS Education Community interested in providing support to Hispanics.
