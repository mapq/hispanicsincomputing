**Birds-of-a-Feather**: Hispanic Ph.D. Community

**Abstract:**
The Hispanic PhD mailing list was founded a few months before the Tapia 2009 Conference. At the conference, an informal meeting was called by Dr. Jose Andre Morales to meet up face to face. Today the mailing list contains 140 of members who span faculty, administrators, academia, industry and students. The list members are featured in the CAHSI website. This BoF will report to the community of advances made since the last meeting. The gathering will also discuss other issues facing Hispanics such as the DREAM act and the low representation in academia (according to the Taulbee report). We want to learn from the audience how they would like the group to evolve in the future. We would also like to discuss how institutions can better serve Hispanics in the U.S.

**Organizer**: Jose Morales, University of Texas, San Antonio
