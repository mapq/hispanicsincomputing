**Birds of a Feather**: Hispanics in Computing

**Abstract:**
The Hispanics in Computing community was founded a few months before the Tapia 2009 Conference. Since then, the group has been meeting at this annual conference. The group has grown in numbers and online presence (Facebook, LinkedIn, and now a website http://www.hispanicsincomputing.com/). The impact of this gathering in our community has been tremendous. Several members of the community who attended our BoF as young graduate students are now in tenure-track positions or employed in research organizations. Once again, we propose to hold our annual BoF at the Tapia Conference. The gathering will allow many of us to meet face-to-face and discuss issues facing Hispanics. These past few years have really demonstrated the importance of community to getting students through their programs, new professionals through their early career years, and more established professionals continue to make and achieve new goals. The goal for this year’s gathering is to address the problem of being the “one and only” Latino/Hispanic in your position. While the annual BoF is an invaluable resource for us to reconnect with our community, when many of us go home we are the “one and only” at our jobs. Building and maintaining relationships with other Latino/Hispanic computer scientists throughout the year will aid in the success of the retention of Hispanics in computing. By the way, we also take great colorful pictures as seen on the Tapia BOF website.

**Organizers**:

* Dr. Brianna Posadas (Virginia Tech)
* Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola (University of Notre Dame)
* Dr. Oscar Veliz (Northeastern University)
* Alexis Cruz-Ayala (Duke University)
