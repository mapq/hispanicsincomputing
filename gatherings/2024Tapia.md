We will be gathering at our annual Birds of a Feather at the Tapia Conference.

**Birds of a Feather**: Hispanics in Computing

**Abstract:**

The Hispanics in Computing group was founded a few months before the Tapia 2009 Conference and has met at this annual conference ever since. The gathering allows many of us to meet face-to-face and discuss issues facing Hispanics. These past few years have increased the need for the community to come together to help students through their programs, professionals through their early career years, and more established professionals to make and achieve new goals. The goal for this year’s BoF gathering is to explore how to maintain a supportive community in the face of the challenges that equity and inclusion is facing in this country. The impact of these gatherings has been tremendous. Several members of the community that attended our BoF as young graduate students are now in tenure track positions or employed in research organizations. The group has a strong online presence (listserv, Facebook, LinkedIn, and website <http://www.hispanicsincomputing.com/>) and looks forward to this family reunion at the conference.
