**Birds of a Feather**: Hispanics in Computing Community

**Abstract:**
The HispanicPhD mailing list was founded a few months before the Tapia 2009 Conference. At the 2011 Conference in San Francisco we changed the name and expanded the group to include all Hispanics in Computing (not just PhD level). As a result of the conference, a new listserv was created and a Facebook group. This proposal seeks to create a BoF for the Hispanics in Computing community. The gathering will allow many of us to meet face to face and discuss issues facing Hispanics. We want to learn from the audience how they would like the group to evolve in the future. We would also like to discuss how institutions can better serve Hispanics in the U.S.

**Organizer**: Jos√© Morales (Carnegie Mellon University)
