**Birds of a Feather:**  Hispanics in Computing Community  

**Abstract:**
The Hispanics in Computing community was founded a few months before the Tapia 2009 Conference. Since then, the group has been meeting at this annual conference. The impact of this gathering in our community has been tremendous. Several members of the community that attended our BoF as young graduate students are now in tenure track positions or employed in research organizations. As the undergraduate population attending Tapia grows, it is important that we serve as mentors for the new students starting their careers in computing. The goal for this yearâ€™s gathering is to explore how to do virtual mentoring to help increase ties within the community. Bringing us together allows us to continue nurturing and sponsoring younger Hispanics to succeed in computing.

**Organizers:**
